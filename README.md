# ML <br/>

Q:What models are there in machine learning?

Each model is designed to address specific types of problems or tasks:

Supervised Learning Models:
```python
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Neural Networks
 i) Feedforward Neural Networks
 ii) Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)
Gradient Boosting Machines
 i) XGBoost: widely used for structured/tabular data.
 ii) LightGBM: efficient for large datasets.
 iii) CatBoost:  for categorical features.
Ridge Regression: useful for preventing overfitting.
Lasso Regression: Identifying important features.
